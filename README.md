# EEG Signal Classification

## Introduction

- EEG stands for electroencephalogram, and it measures the electrical activity in your brain from the synaptic excitations of your neuronsâ€™ dendrites.
- The human brain has unique brain wave frequencies. There are five types of brain waves - Gamma, Beta (low, midrange, and high beta as its sub-sections), Alpha, Theta, and Delta waves ordered by the depth of brain waves [[1]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDAMT.2018.8376536).


## Data

- The data used for performing classification of EEG signal was taken from [Jordan Bird et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329403546_Mental_Emotional_Sentiment_Classification_with_an_EEG-based_Brain-machine_Interface)
- The dataset has been processed by Jordan Bird et al.
- The data was collected from two people (one male and one female) for 3 minutes/state - 'positive', 'neutral', 'negative'.

## Code
- The files for each of the models are located in the *Models* folder.
- The code file are Python Notebooks.
- Each file contains a detailed analysis of the model, this includes the ***confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1-score, and support***.
- Libraries Used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, tensorflow, and keras.

## Results

- The Table below shows the various models created.
- As shown the best model is *Model 5* in terms of Accuracy and Validation Accuracy.
